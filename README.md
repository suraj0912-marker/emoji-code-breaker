# 🔐 Emoji Code Breaker

Hi! I'm **Suraj Behra**, and this is a fun little project I built called **Emoji Code Breaker** 🎮

It's a logic-based game where you need to guess the **secret 4-emoji code**. You get **10 chances**, and after each guess, you receive color-coded feedback to help you break the code. Inspired by the classic game **Mastermind**, but this one is emoji-based and made fully with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
